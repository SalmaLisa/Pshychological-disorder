          <h2>With Kenny Gajewski as its head coach,</h2>
          <p class="text">
            Oklahoma State softball appeared in three-consecutive Women’s
            College World Series from 2019-22, claimed its first conference
            title of the Big 12 era in 2022 and has reestablished itself as a
            national power. Gajewski (pronounced ‘GUY-eh-ski’) has guided the
            Cowgirls to NCAA postseason play every year since his arrival.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            The leader of perhaps the greatest program transformation of the
            decade, Gajewski would say the change has nothing to do with him and
            everything to do with the players, to whom the OSU softball program
            belongs. It is clear the decision making of Gajewski and his staff
            is aligned with that philosophy.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            Just one of the real-world examples of how he applies this approach
            has become an offseason tradition for the Cowgirls. Each August, as
            the Cowgirls converge on Stillwater to start the school year,
            Gajewski and his staff coordinate a team trip to Broken Bow,
            Oklahoma, as an opportunity for a new group of student-athletes to
            become familiar with each other as people, not just as players. The
            retreat has yielded such positive results during the offseason that
            Gajewski has implemented the trip into the Cowgirls’ postseason in
            each of the last two seasons.

              Gajewski has proven time and again that he is able to welcome
              high-level talent into the OSU program and facilitate a winning
              culture. In just the past four seasons, Samantha Show (Texas A&M),
              Carrie Eberle (Virginia Tech), Alysen Febrey (Georgia) and Hayley
              Busby (Virginia) earned All-America status for the first time in
              their respective careers after transferring to OSU.
